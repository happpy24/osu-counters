# How to create pp counter

To start creating pp counters you need to download `VS Code` (or other IDE), [tosu](https://github.com/KotRikD/tosu/releases) or [gosu](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory/releases) and `quickstart example`.

Then you need a little bit knowledge about css, html, javascript (or you can just google or ChatGPT most of stuff).

1. Download required tools:
    1. Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or any other `IDE`
        1. [How to install VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPZsB_6yHVo)

    3. Download [tosu](https://github.com/KotRikD/tosu/releases) or [gosu](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory/releases)
2. Create `new folder` anywhere
